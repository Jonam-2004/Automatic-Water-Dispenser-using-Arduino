# Automatic Water Dispenser

An IoT-enabled system designed to automate water dispensing and refilling using Arduino, IR sensors, and water level sensors. This project ensures efficient water management by eliminating manual intervention, making it suitable for household, industrial, and agricultural applications.

## üìã Project Overview

The **Automatic Water Dispenser** automates the process of dispensing water when needed and refilling the water container when it reaches a low threshold. The system uses an **IR sensor** to detect a water cup's presence and a **water level sensor** to monitor the water levels in the container. When the water level drops, a pump is activated to refill the container automatically.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Water Dispensing**: Detects the presence of a cup and dispenses water.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors water levels in the container.
- **Smart Refilling**: Automatically refills the container when the water level drops below the threshold.
- **IoT Integration**: Arduino-based system with simple yet effective automation.
- **Cost-effective Design**: Uses readily available hardware components.

## üìå Objectives

1. Automate the water dispensing process using an IR sensor.
2. Use a water level sensor to monitor container levels and trigger refilling when needed.
3. Prevent water wastage through precise dispensing and refilling.
4. Provide a scalable, cost-effective solution for various applications.

## WORKING:

The IR sensor detects when an object is near the dispenser. When detected, the system turns on the water pump to dispense water.The water level sensor monitors the water level in the tank. If the water level drops below a predefined threshold (waterLevelRefillThreshold), the refill pump is triggered, and it continues to refill the tank until the water level reaches an upper threshold (waterLevelLowThreshold).The status of the water level and system operation is displayed via the Serial Monitor for debugging and monitoring purposes.
